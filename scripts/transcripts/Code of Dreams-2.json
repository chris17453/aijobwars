{"text": " From the mind of Chris Watkins, a coder bold. A game took shape, a story told. With his Threadripper running Linux, he took the helm. Crafting the world from the digital realm. With lines of code, he built with Glee. A game from scratch, wild and free. No fame in mind, just joy and play. Chris, the coder, paved his own way. Just him, nobody else. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Characters danced, pixels flew. In Chris's game, dreams came true. Unemployed by undeterred, he delved into the depths of code where wonders swell. His Threadripper hummed, Linux shone bright. Guiding his hands through the digital night. No plans for glory, just passion's flame. As Chris's creation bore his name, okay, it's cool. AI job wars. From the depths of his imagination, it arose. A testament to the power that coding bestows. Unemployed but fulfilled, he stood tall. For in his game, he found his own.
