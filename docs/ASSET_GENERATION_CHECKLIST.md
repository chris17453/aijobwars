## Notes for Asset Creators

1. **Transparency is critical** - Without alpha channels, layering won't work
2. **Maintain consistent style** - Futuristic/dystopian aesthetic throughout
3. **Follow script suggestions** - Audio narration should match provided text
4. **Test early** - Generate L2-L4 first to validate workflow
5. **Document issues** - Note any problems in this file for team reference
